As a bonus exercises you can also...

- Update the main/main.go source file to accept a YAML file as a flag and then load the YAML from a file rather than from a string.
- Build a JSONHandler that serves the same purpose, but reads from JSON data.
- Build a Handler that doesn't read from a map but instead reads from a database. Whether you use BoltDB, SQL, or something else is entirely up to you.
